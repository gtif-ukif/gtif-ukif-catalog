  "Description": "Satellites like Sentinel-2 have the ability to see subtle signatures in the atmosphere that indicate the presence of methane emissions. This image is a heatmap of a the presence in a vertical column of atmosphere in units of mol/m^2. The dark regions shows the presence of two large methane emission plumes. Post-processing can be used to characterize these methane plumes in terms of emissions rates.",
