  "Description": "There was a detected methane leak in this region, however the signal is too faint to be directly seen with Sentinel-2 imagery. Nevertheless, we do see hints of this signal when we look at a time-series of the integrated amount of methane over the entire region. That is the over-all amount of methane shows a significant increase on May 20, 2023 (near the peak of reported emissions) compared to surrounding dates.",
